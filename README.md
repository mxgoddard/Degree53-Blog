# Degree 53 Blog Tech Test

Create a .NET Core C# solution for a simple blog.

### Requirements

* The application must be a .Net Core MVC solution.
* The application must use a database. Use SQL Server Express LocalDB to ensure the complete solution is self contained.
* There must be an admin interface in order to add new blog articles.
* Each blog article must have its own detail page.
* Use Dependency Injection
* The site must not use bootstrap for styles, however there should be at the very least basic styles. Be as creative as you wish, but don’t spend too long.

### Notes

* The application should utilise best practices for code that you write
* The submitted application must be the complete solution, with database, and not a compiled version of the site.
* Please provide instructions, if you feel they’re necessary
* Use your initiative wherever possible, and have fun with it.

### Database

Database name is 'db_degree53-blog'. Ordinarily the appsettings.json would be on the .gitignore file or the connection strings hidden.
